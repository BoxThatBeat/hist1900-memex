A rocket is complicated, when one thing fails such as an o-ring, a chain reaction can occur that destroys the whole ship. 
A car highway is more of a complex system, where each component works together but independently. When someone breaks in front of you, it becomes a chain reaction/wave. The property that this highway traffic can recover is an **emergence**.
